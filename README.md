It simulate a banking web application where a person:

- Can access his banking account using username and password (there is just 2 test data because the app is not based on a database)
- Enter Username = ao and password = 1111 OR Username = jd and password = 2222
- The banking interface is charged and you can see the movements, request loan, tansfere money to the other account, and close your account
- a timer starts when you login and the session closes after the time is up
